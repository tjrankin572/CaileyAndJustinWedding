## Purpose
A simple static website for my sister's wedding.
My first project where I utilized Netlify to host my websites.
I loved learning how to utilize Hugo for incredibly simple use cases.

## What I learned
1. What kind of style I wanted to pursue for my single page websites.
2. It taught me the importance of doing a mobile first design as it was trickier to implement towards the end of the project.
